Hello,

I am an ecologist, interested in animal movement, migration and population dynamics. With the aid 
of field observation, movement tracking and big dataset I try to understand the mechanisms 
underlying their population change.

During my PhD journey in Australia, I investigated the effects of weather and climate change on 
long-distance avian migrants. Specifically, I explored how birds select their flight altitude and 
migration routes in relation to various conditions both in the atmosphere and on the ground. I 
also examined what factors contribute to the population decline of White-naped crane.

Currently I am a postdoctoral associate at Cornell Lab of Ornithology, studying macro-demography 
of North American birds using eBird citizen science dataset and other climatic models. The goal 
is to elucidate how extreme climatic events could explain demographic variation throughout the 
annual cycle of bird populations.
